## Overview 
**MosAIC: Mosquito-Associated Isolate Collection**
MosAIC (Mosquito-Associated Isolate Collection), a resource consisting of 392 bacterial isolates from mosquitoes. These isolates come with extensive metadata and high-quality draft genome assemblies, publicly available for use by the scientific community. Please see https://kcoonlab.bact.wisc.edu/mosaic/ for more information. 

## Analysis Overview 
Scripts for each analysis are written in R. Each directory contains necessary files and code to recreate each figure of the manuscript. To repeat the analysis, clone the repository, and the run each script. Do not `cd` into the cloned repository. 

**Example**
Create a new project in RStudio. To run the scripts in 01_GenomeQC to recreate Figure 1B in the manuscript. 
* Navigate to the terminal window and `git clone https://github.com/MosAIC-Collection/MosAIC_V1`.
* Open open the script `checkM_analysis.R` from the files panel window.
* Install required packages. 
* `cmd enter` from line `1`.

## Recreate the Manuscript Figures
Once the repository has been cloned (above), recreate each figure as follows: 

**Fig 1 Origin of bacterial isolates in MosAIC**
