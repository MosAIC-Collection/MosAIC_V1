## Overview 
**MosAIC: Mosquito-Associated Isolate Collection**
MosAIC (Mosquito-Associated Isolate Collection), a resource consisting of 392 bacterial isolates from mosquitoes. These isolates come with extensive metadata and high-quality draft genome assemblies, publicly available for use by the scientific community. Please see https://kcoonlab.bact.wisc.edu/mosaic/ for more information. 

## Analysis Overview 
Scripts for each analysis are written in R. Each directory contains necessary files and code to recreate each figure of the manuscript. To repeat the analysis, clone the repository, and the run each script. Do not `cd` into the cloned repository. 

**Example**
Create a new project in RStudio. To run the scripts in 01_GenomeQC to recreate Figure 1B in the manuscript. 
* Within terminal `git clone https://github.com/MosAIC-Collection/MosAIC_V1`
* Open `checkM_analysis.R` in the files panel window.
* `cmd enter` to run each step

## Recreate the Manuscript Figures
Once the repository has been cloned (above), recreate each figure as follows: 

**Fig 1 Origin of bacterial isolates in MosAIC**
* Fig 1 - Script: `04_Sankey_Diagram/Metadata_Snakey_Diagram.R`: run code from line `1` to `127`

**Fig 2 Phylogeny of single species representatives from MosAIC, along with quality-assurance metrics for related genome assemblies**
* Fig 2A - Script: `03_MosAIC_Phylogeny/plot_tree_metadata.R`: run code from line `1` to `257`
* Fig 2B - Script: `01_Genome_QC/checkM_analysis.R`: run code from line `1 to `60`
* Fig 2C - Script: `01_Genome_QC/checkM_analysis.R`: run code from line `1` to `239`
* Fig 2D - Script: `01_Genome_QC/checkM_analysis.R`: run code from line `1` to `136`
* Fig 2E - Script: `01_Genome_QC/checkM_analysis.R`: run code from line `1` to `159`
* Fig 2F - Script: `02_GTDB_Drep_Summary/gtdbtk_drep_stat.R`: run code from line `1` to `112`

**Fig 3 Heatmap of the distribution of virulence factors across all MosAIC genomes**
* Fig 3 - Script: `05_Virulence_Factor_Analysis.R`: run code from line `1` to `192`

**Fig 4 Selected genus population structures with improved mosquito representation**
* Fig 4A-C - Script: `06b_EnterobacterPopulationStructure/Enterobacter_Pop_Struc.R`: run code from line `1` to `426`
* Fig 4D-F - Script: `06a_SerratiaPopulationStructure/Serratia_Genus_Pop_Structure.R`: run code from line `1` to `370`
* Fig 4G-H - Script: `06c_ElizabethkingiaPopulationStructure/ElizabethkingiaPopStruc.R`: run code from line `1` to `300`

**Fig 5 Pangenomes of Enterobacter asburiae, Serratia marcescens, and Elizabethkingia anophelis with highlighted mosquito-associated lineages**
* Fig 5A - Script: `07b_EnterobacterPangenome/EnterobacterPangenomeTree.R`: run code from line `1` to `249` 
* Fig 5B - Script: `07a_SerratiaPangenome/SerratiaMPangenome.R`: run code from line `1` to `210`
* Fig 5C - Script: `07c_ElizabethkingiaPangenome/Elizabethkingia_Anophelis_Pangenome.R`: run code from line `1` to `177`
